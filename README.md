Project Summary: Face Emotion Detection
Participants:

Jatin Malik (E23CSEU1415)
Aayush Signal (E23CSEU1430)
Milestone Context:
This project marks the second milestone in our journey towards developing an advanced avatar creation system that utilizes facial recognition technology for emotion analysis. Our first milestone focused on building a simple face recognition system, providing the foundational knowledge necessary for this more complex task.

Project Overview:
The Face Emotion Detection project aims to implement a robust system capable of accurately detecting and classifying human emotions based on facial expressions.

This project builds on our foundational knowledge of facial recognition and advances our goal of creating avatars that respond to users' emotional states. By accurately analyzing and classifying emotions, we aim to enhance user engagement and personalization in virtual environments, paving the way for more meaningful digital interactions.
